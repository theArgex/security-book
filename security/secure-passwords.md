# Secure Passwords

![xkcd: Password Strength](../.gitbook/assets/password_strength.png)

The comic above has some good points a short totally random password isn't any better than a long password with real words. Either way, the securest way to find a new password is to generate it or create it with a real dictionary and a dice. Thinking about random words on your own and dicing a few special characters in there seems like a good idea at first. But it really isn't a study shows that people asked for a random word usually come up with the same hundred words. So try to get your password as random as possible with something other than your mind only. As the comic shows, pass-phrases are better because they are easier to make longer and way easier to remember. But still, if you use services like KeePass it's usually better to create a totally random long password not even you know. Because if not even you know it it isn't possible for a social engineer to get the password out of without asking for access to your password vault.
